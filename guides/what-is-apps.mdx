title: "What is Applications"
---

Within the Mutable Web, `applications` are the building blocks that shape our online experience, serving as adaptable units of functionality that you can mix, match, and transform. Traditionally, applications have been closed ecosystems—pre-packaged solutions that users passively accept as-is. But in a mutable environment, they are not static, finished products. Instead, they’re catalysts for mutation, enabling continual change, improvement, and personalization.

This shift means you’re no longer restricted to the default configurations and features set by a central authority. Instead, you can seamlessly integrate multiple services, reshape their interfaces, or expand their capabilities. By treating applications as evolving, customizable elements rather than fixed endpoints, you gain the freedom to modify them at will—remixing, enhancing, and reimagining their purpose.

Ultimately, applications become dynamic tools for self-expression and innovation. They encourage a fluid, participatory digital landscape where you’re not just a passive consumer but an active co-creator. In the Mutable Web, applications are not just products you use—they’re parts of a living, evolving network that you can continually refine to meet your own changing needs.
