title: "Key Components"
description: "The Mutable Web is built on a set of foundational components that work together to redefine how we interact with digital content. Each component plays a critical role in enabling customization, integration, and collaboration, making the web more dynamic, user-centric, and adaptable. Let’s explore these key components:"

## Insertion Points

Insertion points are predefined locations within a web page where modifications can be applied. They serve as the anchors for integrating new functionalities, tools, or visual enhancements without disrupting the underlying website’s structure.

* **Precision**: Target specific areas of a webpage for modification.

* **Flexibility**: Enable seamless integration of widgets or applications.

* **Non-Intrusive**: Maintain the integrity of the original web content while enhancing its usability.

By using insertion points, developers and users can create impactful changes that blend naturally into the web experience.

## Widgets

Widgets are modular, self-contained units of functionality that can be added to web pages. From displaying real-time data to introducing interactive tools, widgets provide users with the ability to extend the capabilities of any website.

Examples of Widgets:

* **Content Enhancers**: Add translations, summaries, or annotations to web pages.

* **Interactive Tools**: Embed calculators, polls, or form-fillers.

* **Visual Overlays**: Customize themes or layouts with new design elements.

Widgets empower users to personalize their online experience while offering developers an opportunity to innovate within an open ecosystem.

The `WidgetProps` interface serves as a contract for the properties and methods that a widget must implement to interact effectively with the BOS component and the platform. This documentation outlines the structure and functionality of the `WidgetProps` interface.

```javascript
interface WidgetProps {
  context: TransferableContext;
  link?: {
    id: UserLinkId; // Static link ID can also be here
    authorId: string;
  };
  notify: (modalProps: ModalProps) => void;
  query: (target: Target) => TransferableContext | null;
  linkDb: {
    get: (
      ctx: TransferableContext,
      accountIds?: string[] | string,
      indexRules?: LinkIndexRules
    ) => Promise<LinkedDataByAccountDto>;
    set: (
      ctx: TransferableContext,
      dataByAccount: LinkedDataByAccountDto,
      indexRules: LinkIndexRules
    ) => Promise<void>;
  };
  commitDocument: (
    appDocId: DocumentId,
    appDocMeta: DocumentMetadata,
    ctx: TransferableContext,
    dataByAccount: LinkedDataByAccountDto
  ) => Promise<void>;
  getDocument: () => Promise<DocumentDto | null>;
}
```

<Accordion title="Properties" defaultOpen={false}>
  `context: TransferableContext` Represents the current context in which the widget is operating. It is an instance of `TransferableContext`, allowing the widget to access relevant data and functionality within its operational scope.



  `link:` An optional object containing link information.



  `id:` A static link ID, represented as UserLinkId.



  `authorId:` The ID of the author associated with the link.



  `notify:` A function used to trigger notifications or modals within the platform. It takes `modalProps` as a parameter, which contains properties for the modal to be displayed.



  `query:` A function that allows the widget to perform queries against the specified target. It returns a `TransferableContext` or null if the query fails.



  `linkDb: `An object containing methods for interacting with the link database.



  `get:`  `Parameters:`  `ctx: TransferableContext:` The current context.



  `accountIds?: `	`string[] | string:` An optional parameter to specify account IDs.



  `indexRules?:`	`LinkIndexRules:` An optional parameter for indexing rules.&#x20;

  `Returns:` A promise that resolves to `LinkedDataByAccountDto`, containing linked data by account.



  `set: Parameters:` `ctx: TransferableContext:` The current context.



  `dataByAccount:` `LinkedDataByAccountDto:` The data to be set.



  `indexRules: LinkIndexRules:` The indexing rules to apply.

  `Returns:` A promise that resolves when the data has been set.



  `commitDocument:`	A function to commit a document to the platform.
  Parameters: `appDocId:` `DocumentId:` The ID of the document to commit.



  `appDocMeta:` `DocumentMetadata:` Metadata associated with the document.



  `ctx:` `TransferableContext:` The current context.



  `dataByAccount:` `LinkedDataByAccountDto:` The linked data to associate with the document.

  `Returns:` A promise that resolves when the document has been committed.



  `getDocument:`	A function that retrieves the current document associated with the widget. It returns a promise that resolves to a `DocumentDto` or `null` if no document is found.



  **Conclusion**

  The `WidgetProps` interface plays a crucial role in facilitating the interaction between the BOS component and the platform. By defining a clear structure for the properties and methods, it ensures that widgets can efficiently manage context, links, notifications, and document interactions.

## Controllers

Controllers act as the bridge between widgets and the underlying web content. They manage how widgets interact with the page and ensure that modifications align with user preferences.

Key Functions:

* **Orchestration**: Coordinate the behavior of multiple widgets to create a cohesive experience.

* **Customization**: Allow users to fine-tune widget settings and interactions.

* **Consistency**: Ensure a smooth and reliable experience across different websites.

Controllers simplify the process of managing complex web interactions, making advanced customization accessible to everyone.

## Applications

Applications in the Mutable Web are collections of widgets and controllers designed to work in harmony. They provide a comprehensive set of tools and functionalities tailored to specific use cases or user needs.

Examples of Applications:

* **Productivity Suites**: Integrate task management, note-taking, and calendar tools into your favorite platforms.

* **E-Commerce Enhancements**: Add price comparison, coupon finders, or product reviews directly to online shopping pages.

* **Accessibility Solutions**: Implement tools for screen readers, high-contrast modes, or text resizing.

Applications offer an end-to-end solution for creating highly customized and feature-rich web experiences.

## Why these components matter

The interplay of insertion points, widgets, controllers, and applications creates a powerful ecosystem that:

* **Empowers Users**: Take control of your web experience with tools and features that match your needs.

* **Inspires Developers**: Build innovative solutions that integrate seamlessly with any website.

* **Drives Collaboration**: Foster a community-driven approach to web customization and improvement.

These components are the foundation of the Mutable Web’s mission to transform the internet into a dynamic, adaptive, and user-first environment.

The Mutable Web is more than a set of tools—it’s a new way to experience the internet. By understanding and leveraging its key components, you can unlock endless possibilities for customization, innovation, and collaboration.
