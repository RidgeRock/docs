**Mutations** are the primary mechanism for altering a website’s **appearance** or **functionality** without modifying its underlying code. They:

- **Facilitate Customization:** Enable users to add, replace, or refine website features seamlessly.  
- **Ensure Compatibility:** Overlay enhancements without disrupting the original web content.  
- **Expand Opportunities:** Offer tools that enhance accessibility, productivity, and aesthetics.  

From enabling **dark mode** to embedding **custom workflows**, **mutations** empower users to craft personalized web experiences efficiently.

## Users

**Users** are the **core participants** in the Mutable Web. They actively shape their digital experiences by:

- **Applying Mutations:** Modifying websites with features, tools, and layouts tailored to their needs.  
- **Selecting Preferences:** Personalizing online interactions by choosing preferred widgets and configurations.  
- **Collaborating:** Sharing feedback, ideas, and innovations to continuously refine the ecosystem.  

This empowerment transforms **users** from **passive consumers** into **active contributors**, enabling a web that adapts to individual needs.

## Mutators

**Mutators** are the **engines** that execute mutations. They act as intermediaries, ensuring that modifications are applied **efficiently** and **effectively**. They:

- **Define Interactions:** Establish how mutations interact with the content and functionality of a site.  
- **Manage Dependencies:** Coordinate tools or widgets to prevent conflicts.  
- **Enhance Flexibility:** Enable developers to create scalable, reusable solutions adaptable to various contexts.  

Mutators are the **technical backbone** translating **user needs** into **functional web changes**.
