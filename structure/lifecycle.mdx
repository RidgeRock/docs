title: "Universal LifeCycle"
description: "In the Mutable Web, every interaction with applications, mutations, and objects follows a consistent workflow, ensuring a seamless and efficient user experience. This universal lifecycle comprises three key stages: Local Change, Publish, and Pull Request."

## Semantic Context

The Mutable Web introduces a structure where each object—whether it’s a **mutation** or a **document**—follows a consistent lifecycle involving **local edits** and **potential publication**.

The process applies universally across all applications, mutations, or objects:

```text
LocalChange => Publish (as Fork, as Update) => Pull Request
```

## Key Stages of the Lifecycle

### **1. Local Change**

When a user initiates an interaction, such as creating or editing an object, changes occur **locally** in their environment. This approach allows users to make multiple adjustments before deciding to make them public.

**Visibility Settings During Local Changes:**

* **`Private`:** Accessible only via ID; not visible in search results or public lists.

* **`Devel`:** Visible only in **developer mode**, ideal for testing and iteration.

* **`Public`:** Fully visible and searchable by others.

This local-first approach ensures flexibility without risking unintended public exposure.

### **2. Publish (as Fork or Update)**

Once satisfied with local changes, users can **publish** their modifications. The method of publication depends on **ownership**:

* **Fork:** If the object was created by someone else, the user forks it to create an independent version.

* **Update:** If the object is the user’s original creation, they can directly publish it as an **update**.

**Context-Sensitive Publish Button:**
The **Publish** button dynamically adapts based on the object’s origin and state, offering the option to **notify the original author** via a `notify origin` checkbox.

<Accordion title="Example of Forking" defaultOpen={false}>
  `Forking a Foreign Mutation:` Fork another author’s mutation, make adjustments, and publish it independently.&#x20;



  `Forking Your Own Mutation:` Fork your mutation to branch into separate versions (e.g., testing vs. production).
</Accordion>

### **Creating a Mutation from Scratch**

Users can also create a **new mutation** without forking an existing one. In this scenario:

* The mutation starts with a **null ID**.

* Once published, it generates a **unique ID**.

### **3. Pull Request**

Integrated into the **Publish** action, the **Pull Request** mechanism allows users to propose changes to the original author.

* By selecting the **`notify origin`** option during publication, the original author is alerted about the proposed modifications.

* This facilitates **collaboration** and **iterative improvements**.

This structured workflow ensures **systematic interaction management**, fostering a collaborative and user-centric environment.

## Special Cases in the LifeCycle

### **Editing Your Own Mutation Without an Origin**

When editing a mutation **without an origin** (not forked from another mutation):

* Changes are treated as **updates**.

* No local copy is created.

* The **ID remains unchanged**.

### **Editing a Mutation with an Origin (Foreign Author)**

When editing a **forked mutation** based on another author’s work:

* Changes remain **local** until published.

* **Origin metadata** is preserved.

* A **`Publish as Fork`** operation is required to maintain the mutation's history.

### **Publishing a Fork**

When publishing a fork:

* The **original mutation remains unaltered**.

* The forked version receives a **unique ID**.

* Forks can be further **edited, published, or forked again**.

## Fork and Edit Lifecycle

Each mutation follows a lifecycle based on its origin and editing context:

<Steps> <Step title="1. Forking Someone Else’s Mutation"> Create a new branch from an existing mutation for independent development. </Step> <Step title="2. Forking Your Own Mutation"> Branch out versions of your mutation for different use cases (e.g., production vs. testing). </Step> <Step title="3. Creating a Mutation from Scratch"> Start fresh with a new mutation, generating a unique ID upon publication. </Step> <Step title="4. Editing Your Own Mutation (No Origin)"> Directly update your original mutation without creating a separate fork. </Step> <Step title="5. Editing Your Own Mutation (With Origin)"> Modify a forked mutation, maintaining origin metadata for clarity and traceability. </Step> </Steps>

This systematic approach ensures clarity and consistency across different mutation workflows.
